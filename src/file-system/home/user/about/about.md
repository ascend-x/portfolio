# Hi there

Iâ€™m Nandakishore V., a Cloud SecOps enthusiast, CTF player, and web developer. I specialize in building secure, scalable systems and love diving into vulnerabilities through ethical hacking and capture-the-flag challenges.

With a passion for cybersecurity, modern web development, and automation in the cloud, I focus on creating solutions that are both robust and innovative.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to explore the work that blends security, code, and creativity.
